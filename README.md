# Exercices-given-in-professionnal-interview-2022-

You will find in this repository two exercices that i have to completed in 2022 for an IT company during the second interview of their recruitment process.

- One exercice (Python_Exercice_Container_With_Most_Water.pdf) was for testing my Python skills.
- The other one (SQL_exercice_Sales department.pdf) was for testing my SQL skills.

You will also find here the solutions i have developped for these exercices. In these solutions, you will find my own precisions about : 
- the time it took me to complete them
- the softwares i have used for both conception and testing
- self-critics for the python exercice, since i estimate that my solution wasn't an ideal one technically, even thought it's a working one. I must precise that my python skills are less developped than my SQL ones, due to me having less experience with python (1 year) in comparison with SQL (2-3 years).

All solutions developped in these exercices have been succesfully tested by me, and have been labelled as successes by the interviewers.
